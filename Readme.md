A simple verified compiler, from the (simple typed, call-by-value) lambda calculus to a simple RAM machine

Goals:

Complete missing steps (currently in typechecking)
Figure out use for other direction of correctness proofs?
Modularize code with classes
Remove runtime tags
User types for printing
Add Parser?
Add pairs, sums, unit, void, nats, primrec? sructured types?
Make printing part of the code
Make initializagtion part of the code
